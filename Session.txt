# Run an instance of a voting season

		#voting Code
		#transaction validated	
		#Destroy the account and the database

		#get 2 such transactions ready
		#Add 2 transactions to block
		#mine and validate the block
		#Add block to blockchain
		#blockchain verification

#Once the voting time interval is finished, call the reaper...

#Once every voter is removed from the session,
#Traverse the Blockchain counting the votes and recalculating the hash for every block again.
#If data gets corrupted during traversal, The current hash of the block changes causing delinking of the chain
